BookStore Web Application

This application was created to increase my knowledge on RESTful APIs and frontend development.
It is a bookstore application that users can log into to purchase books or to see the ones they own.

The application contains a backend through the main src folder and a frontend directory. 
The backend uses Spring Boot to connect to a PostgreSQL database that stores information about the user(Shopper) and the books a user can own(Books).
Spring Boot also accepts authenticated requests from the React application included in the frontend directory. 
In order for users to access their information, they must either log in to an existing account or register a new one.

*The actual store portion will display all available books, but there is currently no payment system. I am still researching the best method to do so.
*I also want to practice Artificial Intelligence, so future development will use AI to recommend books in my database based on user preference.
